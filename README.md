**What is it for?**\
Our common idea to create an auction website for the Lithuanian market.

**How is it different from other auctions?**\
Lithuania doesn't have a working and local auction website. It's different from global auction websites because the buyers can pick up the items directly from the sellers. No need to worry about packaging or lost items.
